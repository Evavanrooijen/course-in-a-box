So! Step one is finding a topic for your project, it is important to select a topic

1. you are interested in generally
2. you would like to learn more about
3. you would like to tell your friends about
4. you would like to teach others about
5. you can make it visual

point 5 might be difficult at this point. Also you might think well what if there is no data available for my hobby?

I can actually not think about a topic that has 0 data available. Think about painting, you can classify pictures of paintings by artist. Think about food, you can cluster food based in nutriotional value.
Of course, there are topics like climate, economics, politics. Here there are many research papers and journalism articles. But you could for example also think about visualizing world hunger or wars.

This lesson is all about finding data and narrowing down a topic. Most important is your affinity with the topic, please select something that you are getting excited about,it will make the process much more fun!
