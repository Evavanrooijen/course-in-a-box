# Hello World!
Welcome to Part 1, happy to meet you here :)

If you are here, you are probably keen on learning and wish to use programming tools (Python!) to retrieve insights from data :geek:

Why Python? 
Well, Python is a easy and broad cooool tool

If you have -  experience in programming, I would recommend to start at initialization step 0
Where we go trough the basics of python for data science projects

Moving on, we start getting our hands dirty on some datasets!
We start by selecting data in our own field of interest, and we finish the course by writing an interesting blog about our findings!
First things first, data!

What is a topic that interests you?

If you are at a loss [insert GIF]

Feel free to take a look at these examples from previous participants
