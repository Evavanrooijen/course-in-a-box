Yiha! You have found a topic and even collected some data!

Noooow, its time to get cracking. We load the dataset into our python environment using the pandas library.
There are many formates for files collecting data.

1. CSV, jeej its nice and friendly
2. JSON, also quite nice and friendly
3. ZIP, well. open it and you will see
4. XLSX, fancy version of CSV
5. XML, oh boy help!
6. SHAPE
7. ...

so, files are in all shapes and pieces but we want a pandas dataframe

## why pandas?
because they look cool

pandas is a nice package for prepping datasets

'''
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv( 'file' ) 
'''

check the box if you were able to print the first lines of your dataframe.... and everything looked nice!
